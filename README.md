This is the code repository for [Building Data Science Solutions with Anaconda](https://www.packtpub.com/product/building-data-science-solutions-with-anaconda/9781800568785?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781800568785), published by Packt.

**A comprehensive starter guide to building robust and complete models**

## What is this book about?
You might already know that there's a wealth of data science and machine learning resources available on the market, but what you might not know is how much is left out by most of these AI resources. This book not only covers everything you need to know about algorithm families but also ensures that you become an expert in everything, from the critical aspects of avoiding bias in data to model interpretability, which have now become must-have skills.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Install packages and create virtual environments using conda
* Understand the landscape of open source software and assess new tools
* Use scikit-learn to train and evaluate model approaches
* Detect bias types in your data and what you can do to prevent it
* Grow your skillset with tools such as NumPy, pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks
* Solve common dataset issues, such as imbalanced and missing data
* Use LIME and SHAP to interpret and explain black-box models

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
training_data = cali_data.data
target_value = cali_data.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_ split(training_data, target_value, test_size = 0.2, random_state=5)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you’re a data analyst or data science professional looking to make the most of Anaconda’s capabilities and deepen your understanding of data science workflows, then this book is for you. You don’t need any prior experience with Anaconda, but a working knowledge of Python and data science basics is a must.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
